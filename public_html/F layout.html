                <p>Nikola Tesla toyed with the idea of “WORLD WIRELESS SYSTEM” in the early 1900s and visionary thinkers like Paul Otlet and Vannevar.
                    Bush conceived of mechanized, searchable storage systems of books and media in the 1930s and 1940s.

                <p>The internet as we know it did not exist until much later, but internet history started much in 1960s.
                   In 1962, MIT computer scientist J.C.R. Licklider came up with the idea for a global computer network.
                    He later shared his idea with colleagues at the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).
                   Licklider was instrumental in conceiving, funding and managing the research that led to modern personal computers and the Internet.

            <p>Work by Leonard Kleinrock and Lawrence G. Roberts on packet-switching theory pioneers the way to the world’s first wide-area computer network.
                Roberts later published a plan for the ARPANET, an ARPA-funded computer network that became a reality in 1969.
	            Over the following years, the ARPANET grew.Kleinrock published research on the theory and application of queuing theory to computer networks.
                Roberts managed its implementation and contracted with Leonard Kleinrock in 1968 to carry out mathematical modelling of the packet-switched network's performance.

            <p>While working at Xerox, Robert Metcalfe developed a system using cables that allowed for transfer of more data over a network.
                He named this system Alto Aloha, but later it wasn named as Ethernet.
               Over the next few years, Ted Nelson proposed hypertext to organize network information, and Unix became popular for TCP/IP networks.
